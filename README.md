## Architecture Spike

This is architecture spike for SSPx as SSP is migrated from on-premise application towards Cloud.

### Goals
- Mitigate primary risks identified in SSPx Architecture prioritization (i.e., Usability, Testability, Maintainability)
- Modernize development stack (e.g., VS.NET 2017, ASP.NET Core)
- Understand risks for Cloud migration and prepare for Azure IAAS or PAAS deployment
- Plan for future evolution (e.g., decouple from IIS)

### Known Issues
- Need to understand Repository strategy with regards to Ckeys
- Need to fix some integration tests

### History
- 2018.06.29.  Release Block #1.  Architecture Spike.
- 2018.07.20.  Release Block #2.  Defuse land mines.  UI controls risk.
